This is a closed book, closed internet exam. This is meant to gauge where the class is as a whole following our online prep phase. Please complete these questions using only Vim. When you're done please send the file to myself via email. ryan@codingnomads.co Take your time, and have fun! 

1) What are the three primary tenants of Object Oriented Programming (OOP):
Inheritance
Polymorphims
Encapsulation

2) Why is OOP useful?
Helps you modelate the real world easier

3) What must a subclass constructor do if the superclass does not have a default constructor?
Needs to call the constructor of the parent class via 'super'

4) What is it called when you have two or more methods in the same class that have the same name but different arguments?
Method Overloading

5) What is it called when you have two more constructors in the same class that have the same name but different arguments?
Constructor overloading

6) What aspect of OOP do the answers to two previous questions support?
Polymorphism

7) Explain public, private, protected and default?
This words gives the visibility of the methods and variables to other classes.

8) Explain the steps to compile and run a Java program from the command line. Assume that the Java program is in a package title, "package codingnomads.forever;"
javac codingnomads.forever

9) How do you pass arguments to a Java application from the CLI? How do you access those arguments once inside the main() method?
java <classname> argument1 argument2 ...

10) Write a simple main method that will print out the first and last arguments that were passed in from the command line:
public static void main(String[] args){
		sout(args[0]);
		sout(args[args.length - 1])
	}

11) Now modify that method so that it fails gracefully if no (or not enough) arguments were passed in:
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println(args[0]);
            System.out.println(args[args.length]);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("No arguments passed");
        }
    }

12) What are the two ways we can create a multithreaded program?
Implement runnable 
or extend Thread


13) Write a very simple example of each below:
For Runnable: 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread myThread = new Thread(myRunnable);
        myThread.start();

        MyRunnable2 myRunnable2 = new MyRunnable2();
        Thread myThread2 = new Thread(myRunnable2);
        myThread2.start();
    }
	public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {

	    @Override
	    public void run() {
	        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() +" "+ this.getClass().getName() + " Hello im Runnable");
		 }
	}

############################
For Thread:
    public static void main(String[] args) {        
        MyRunnableThread myRunnableThread1 = new MyRunnableThread();
        myRunnableThread1.start();
    }


14) Create a custom exception below:

15) Write a very simple method that demonstrates throwing the exception above:

16) Explain the following:
	- throw: 
	- throws: 
	- continue: 
	- break: 
	- return: 

17) write the complete method signature of the main() method below:
	
18) Write a complete generic method that takes in an array of (any) numeric data type (and only numeric data types) and returns the sum of all numbers in the array as a double:

19) Explain the following - and give an example class (just the name of the class) for each:
	- byte stream: 
	- character stream: 
	- buffered stream: 

20) Explain the difference between a static and non-static variable:

21) How do you call a non-static method from a static context?
	
22) What does static mean? Why/where/when would we use static as opposed to non-static?

23) Write a complete method that reverses an array in place using only one extra variable:

24) When should you throw an exception rather than catch the exception?

25) Demonstrate a while loop, and a for loop, that print out every other odd number between 1000 and 0 in a descending fashion:

26) What is pass by value? How does it compare to pass by reference?

27) How comfortable do you feel answering the questions above?

28) Please outline the workflow for Git & GitHub - be as specific as possible

29) Please write down as many CLI commands that you can think of:

30) Please explain what a method "return type" is:

31) Please demonstrate a switch statement below:

32) What does it mean to "pass" values to a method? 

33) What are method parameters?

34) What is an instance variable? How does an instance variable differ from other variables in a class/method?

35) Please demonstrate the use of a "for each" loop:

36) What is an interface? What makes an interface unique?

37) Please demonstrate a complete try/catch/finally block:

38) When do we use "throw" and "throws"?

39) How comfortable do you feel with the material covered above?

40) Please create a new GitHub repository on your GitHub called "checkpoints" and push this file to it. Please send Roi and Trevor a link to this file on your GitHub after you have pushed it to your GitHub.
	Hint: use "git remote add <your_name> <url_to_your_new_repo>" to add a second remote repository then use "git push <your_name> master" to push the code to your repoistory rather than mine.

41) What grade would you give yourself on this exam?

Bonus: Write a bubble sort - extra bonus, make that bubble sort generic:

Double Bonus: Write a Queue and/or Stack class - extra bonus - make it generic:
